Python1: I didn't find which object had a 'source' attribute, so I hardcoded it. I am  also using python 3.6.
Ansible1: Frankly saying I didnt had such experience before, so I used documentation a lot. I believe my solution is a workaround and there is a better way to get the task done. 
Docker1: Done
Python2: I AM USING PYTHON 3.6. Here I used a part of my own script to calculate IP addresses list (subnet calculator). This script is not ideal (I didnt implement any needed verifications of entered values or all possible exceptions). And it implies that user enters a correct IP and mask. I added comments to script with my ideas. I also tested it on my loopback IPs 127.0.0.x. I also silently dropped catched exceptions.
